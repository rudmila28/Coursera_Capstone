## Coursera_Capstone (The Battle of Neighborhoods)

**This is my Capstone Project for 'IBM Professional Certification in Data Science' **

The objective of this Project is to identify better facilities around different neighborhoods which help people exploring these facilities smartly to take effective decision by selecting great neighborhood out of many other neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toronto.
A lot of people are migrating to a various states of Canada who need to know many important factors like housing prices, reputed schools, available entertainment options, shopping location, food shop and hospital etc. This project aims to enable people looking for better neighborhoods considering the above factors.
Here, I have determined the features of the neighborhood and perform a comparative analysis between them. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both fresh and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.
This project facilitates people by generating awareness of the surrounding area and the neighborhood before moving to the new place.
